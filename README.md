========

**Vilmonic is an artificial life and evolution sandbox game** that takes place in a lonely distant future. You are the last caretaker of the final few life forms on the planet. Protect each animatroid and fungatroid species, analyze their DNA, selectively breed new species, craft tools and buildings, dig rivers and make new islands, fend off the mindless zombitroids, dig up ancient tech, and maybe, possibly, uncover a staircase leading down into the ancient infested underground laboratories...

**This repository is for tracking bugs related to the game.** If you found a bug or have an issue to report, dive in to the issues section here: https://github.com/crystalbrittle/vilmonic/issues
